# Building the distributable

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
./scripts/build_release.ps1
```

About a minute. It builds the GPU shader, freezes the app with PyInstaller,
verifies the packaged GStreamer against the development installation, runs
the packaged executable's self-test, and zips the result.

Pass `-OutputRoot <path>` to build somewhere else, and `-VerifyMedia
<file>, <file>` to also decode real videos through the packaged GStreamer as
part of the build (see [GSTREAMER_BUNDLE.md](GSTREAMER_BUNDLE.md)).

## Why the output is not in `dist/`

This repository normally lives in a OneDrive folder. Building into it uploads
~450 MB on every build, and OneDrive's own file handles make the previous
build's output undeletable — PyInstaller fails with `Access is denied` on
`_internal\...` before it can start. The build therefore goes to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%` by default, and `dist/` and `build/` are in `.gitignore` in
case anyone overrides that.

## What is bundled

- **The build environment's Python, PySide6/Qt and NumPy** — the app runs with no Python
  installed.
- **GStreamer 1.28.6**, pruned to the 40 plugins the app can reach and
  their dependencies — 53 MB of the wheels' 302 — plus the `gi` bindings.
  This is what makes hardware video comparison work on a machine that has
  never seen GStreamer. [GSTREAMER_BUNDLE.md](GSTREAMER_BUNDLE.md) says what
  is kept, why, and how the build proves it still plays everything.
- **Qt**, cut the same way to the three modules the app imports (QtCore,
  QtGui, QtWidgets), the Windows platform plugin, the Windows style, the
  common image formats and their dependencies -- 42 MB of PySide6's 114.
  PyInstaller's Qt hooks would otherwise add a software OpenGL renderer,
  QtMultimedia's FFmpeg, the QML stack, PDF, networking and 96 translations.
  `scripts/qt_bundle.py` decides; the self-test reports the platform plugin,
  style and image formats that actually loaded.
- **`d3d11_tonemap.dll`**, the GPU HDR→SDR shader, built from
  `native/d3d11_tonemap.cpp` as part of the build.
- **`nvdec_frames.dll`, `vpl_frames.dll` and `amf_frames.dll`**, the
  NVIDIA, Intel and AMD decoders the GPU metrics read their frames from
  (`videoqual/core/gpu_frames.py`), built from `native/nvdec_frames.cpp`,
  `native/vpl_frames.cpp` and `native/amf_frames.cpp` by
  `scripts/build_gpu_frames.ps1` (MinGW-w64 g++, as for the tone mapper) as
  part of the build, about 0.3 MB each. They link nothing of the GPU makers':
  each loads its maker's decoder library from the graphics driver at run time
  -- NVIDIA's `nvcuda.dll` and `nvcuvid.dll`, Intel's oneVPL `libvpl.dll`,
  AMD's AMF `amfrt64.dll` -- and NVIDIA's conversion kernels are PTX in the
  source, so no CUDA toolkit or SDK is needed to build them. They contain
  nv-codec-headers', oneVPL's and AMF's API definitions (all MIT), whose
  notices are packaged beside them. Without one, FFmpeg decodes those
  videos as before. `scripts/check_gpu_decoder.py` checks one of them on the
  PC it runs on: pictures against FFmpeg's decode, speed, and GPU scores.
  The build makes these four from the commit's own source every time -- they
  are not in git, so ones left from another commit would be stale -- and so
  needs MinGW-w64 g++ on PATH; it stops without it, and checks all four and
  their notices are in the package.
- **SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli**, the official libjxl 0.12.0 static Windows
  command-line tools. Only these two executables and their notices are copied
  into the bundle; users do not need to install libjxl or a runtime separately.
  In the current build they add about 12 MB installed and 7 MB compressed.
- **Vship GPU libraries** for SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli and CVVDP, in three
  builds: `videoqual/tools/vship/nvidia` (CUDA, the 5.1.1 release), `amd` (HIP,
  the 5.1.1 release) and `vulkan` (any GPU with a Vulkan driver, NVIDIA, AMD and
  Intel alike). The Vulkan build is made from Vship commit 97d0dc5, which
  reports 5.1.2 and is to be released as it, by `scripts/build_vship_vulkan.ps1`
  (MinGW-w64 g++, as for the tone mapper; the same source gives the same file).
  5.1.1's cannot be loaded where Intel's GPU is the only one, and scores
  SSIMULACRA2 far too high on NVIDIA GPUs. Replace the CUDA and HIP builds with
  the 5.1.2 release when it is out; until then FFmpeg upsamples 4:1:0 video to
  4:4:4 for them, as 5.1.1 cannot read it. Settings > GPU
  metrics > GPU backend picks one; Auto, the default, uses CUDA on NVIDIA, HIP
  on AMD and Vulkan on other GPUs, and a build that cannot run hands over to the
  next. A metric a build is measured to score wrongly on a GPU maker's GPUs is
  calculated on the CPU there (`perceptual_vship.SCORED_WRONGLY`, empty now);
  re-measure every build when updating Vship. Where no build can use the GPU,
  the input format is unsupported, or GPU processing fails, SSIMULACRA2 and
  Butteraugli fall back to the bundled CPU tools. The Vship CLI and FFMS2
  decoder are not included; the user's FFmpeg reads every video. A video the
  GPU's own decoder decodes -- NVIDIA's with Vship's CUDA build, Intel's or
  AMD's with any build -- is decoded by the frame decoders above in Vship's
  process, FFmpeg only copying its compressed stream out of the container;
  other videos FFmpeg decodes. Vship and metric notices are packaged beside
  the libraries.
- **libvmaf with CUDA** (`videoqual/tools/libvmaf/libvmaf.dll`), for VMAF and
  VMAF NEG on NVIDIA GPUs only: libvmaf master with the open pull requests
  that let it build with MSVC and fix its CUDA code, built by
  `scripts/build_libvmaf_cuda.ps1` (MSVC, CUDA 13.4, meson and ninja; the
  script lists each pull request and the commit of it merged). The C runtime
  is linked in, so it needs only Windows and the NVIDIA driver; no CUDA
  runtime ships. Where NVIDIA's decoder decodes both videos, they are
  decoded, scaled and widened on the GPU by `nvdec_frames.dll` in libvmaf's
  process, the user's FFmpeg only copying their compressed streams out of
  the containers; otherwise FFmpeg decodes them. VMAF on any other GPU or the CPU, VMAF v1,
  PSNR, SSIM and XPSNR still come from the user's FFmpeg. It adds about 3.3 MB installed,
  1 MB compressed. libvmaf and Vship each run in a process of their own
  (`videoqual/core/isolated.py`), so a crash in either, or in the GPU driver,
  falls back to the CPU instead of closing the app.

## What is not, and why

**FFmpeg and libvmaf.** The app finds them at runtime and prompts for their
location if they are missing. They are left out deliberately (the bundled
libvmaf above scores only VMAF and VMAF NEG on NVIDIA GPUs, and the NVIDIA
decoder above decodes from the compressed streams the user's FFmpeg copies out
of the containers):

- A libvmaf-enabled FFmpeg is another ~80 MB on an already large download.
- FFmpeg licensing depends on its build configuration and linked libraries.
  Redistribution requires reviewing that exact build's obligations; the
  presence of libvmaf alone is not a sufficient licensing classification.
- Users comparing encoders generally already have a specific FFmpeg build
  they trust, and silently shipping a different one invites results that
  disagree with their own command line for reasons nobody can see.

To bundle it anyway, drop `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` beside the
executable and add them to the spec's `datas`; the tool finder checks the
application directory.

## Verifying a build

The packaged executable can check itself:

```powershell
.\VideoQual.exe --self-test
```

It reports FFmpeg, GStreamer and its plugins, and the GPU shader, in a dialog
and at `~\.videoqual\self-test.txt`. `--quiet` skips the dialog and
sets the exit code instead, which is how `build_release.ps1` uses it.

This exists because a broken bundle is not obvious from the outside. GStreamer
failing to load makes playback fall back to FFmpeg silently — the app opens,
the tabs work, and nothing looks wrong until someone plays a video and
wonders why it is slow. The first build off this spec did exactly that, with
GStreamer failing on `No module named 'optparse'`.

## Notes for changing the spec

- **The GStreamer wheels are shipped as data, not frozen as modules.** Each
  computes its own plugin, typelib and scanner paths from `__file__`
  (`gstreamer_libs.environment`). Frozen into the archive, every one of those
  paths would point at a file that does not exist. They are therefore in
  `datas` and in `excludes` — file by file, chosen by
  `scripts/gstreamer_bundle.py`, so change what is shipped there rather than
  in the spec.
- **`scripts/pyi_rth_gstreamer.py` replaces the `.pth` file.** Outside a
  bundle, `gstreamer_bundle.pth` runs `setup_python_environment()` at
  interpreter startup. Frozen apps do not process `.pth` files, so the
  runtime hook does it instead — before the entry script, because GStreamer
  reads those variables when it initialises.
- **Anything `gi` imports must be a `hiddenimport`.** Excluding `gi` from
  analysis means nothing traced its imports. The stdlib modules it reaches
  for are listed in the spec; regenerate with:

  ```powershell
  .venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import pathlib,re,sys,sysconfig; root=pathlib.Path(sysconfig.get_paths()['purelib'])/'gstreamer_python'/'Lib'/'site-packages'; mods={m.group(1).split('.')[0] for f in root.rglob('*.py') for m in re.finditer(r'^\s*(?:import|from)\s+([a-zA-Z_][\w.]*)', f.read_text(errors='replace'), re.M)}; print(sorted(m for m in mods if m in sys.stdlib_module_names))"
  ```

- **Qt modules are excluded by name.** WebEngine, Quick, QML, Charts,
  Multimedia and the rest are never imported; leaving them in roughly doubled
  the bundle.

## Trimming it further

- GStreamer and Qt are already cut to what the app uses. The next largest
  item is NumPy's OpenBLAS at ~20 MB, which NumPy links unconditionally, then
  `python314.dll` and OpenSSL (pulled in by `asyncio`, which `gi` imports).
- `--onefile` produces a single executable instead of a folder. It is nicer
  to hand someone, but it unpacks ~150 MB to a temp directory on every
  launch, which is slow enough to be noticeable.
- UPX compression is off. It reduces the download but is a common
  false-positive trigger for antivirus, which matters more for an unsigned
  binary.

## Releasing

Complete [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md), including the third-party license review.
The bundle ships no GPL GStreamer plugins (the GPL wheels are left out
entirely and the bundled FFmpeg is LGPL 2.1), but leaving FFmpeg external
does not remove the need to review the remaining third-party components.

The executable is unsigned, so SmartScreen will warn on first run. Signing
needs a certificate; without one, "More info → Run anyway" is the path, and
saying so in the release notes saves a lot of questions.
