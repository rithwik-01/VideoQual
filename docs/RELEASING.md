# Publication and release checklist

## Before first publication

- Include the project's MIT `LICENSE` and copyright notice (Rithwik Reddy Eedula).
- Review third-party notices and media/screenshot provenance. Do not assume
  the application's license covers bundled libraries or test media.
- Inspect tracked files **and history** for secrets and private information.
  `.gitignore` does not remove already committed content. Rotate exposed secrets.
- Confirm ownership/permission for all contributions and screenshots.
- Set the GitHub description, topics and repository URL; verify relative links
  from the hosted README.
- Enable Issues, private vulnerability reporting, and branch protection as
  appropriate. Choose a monitored security contact. Enable CI after upload.
- Do not publish a passing-status badge until the hosted checks actually pass.

## Release validation

1. Select a clean commit and record its hash. Keep individual bug fixes in
   separate commits with regression tests.
2. Install development dependencies in a fresh environment. Run `pip check`,
   Ruff and `pytest --packaging` (the packaging checks against the installed
   wheels are skipped without it). Record Python, dependency and FFmpeg
   versions.
3. Test every metric, including SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli through both the
   Vship GPU path and the libjxl CPU fallback, with Settings > GPU metrics >
   GPU backend on Auto and on Vulkan. After updating Vship, compare each
   build's SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli and CVVDP against the CUDA build and
   libjxl, on an NVIDIA and an Intel GPU, before changing
   `perceptual_vship.SCORED_WRONGLY`. Check saved-result round-trip,
   backend-specific cache reuse, still comparison and independent bitrate
   analysis. On an NVIDIA GPU, compare a long run (30 minutes of 4K) with
   Performance > VMAF v0.6.1 and NEG compute set to NVIDIA GPU and to CPU: every
   metric but VMAF and NEG identical, those within 0.001 per frame. After updating `scripts/build_libvmaf_cuda.ps1` (libvmaf or its pull
   requests), check that each pull request still merges and whether upstream
   has merged or replaced it.
4. Test playback on real hardware: H.264/H.265 plus supported software-decoded
   formats, source hold/release, neighbor switching, HDR/SDR, seeking and audio.
5. Build using [BUILD.md](BUILD.md). Review self-test output: the script may
   produce a zip even when self-test warns of failure. Do not release that zip.
6. Launch the extracted bundle from a different directory on a clean Windows
   account or machine. Verify external FFmpeg discovery and graceful fallback.
7. Audit the exact bundled components, preserve their notices, and satisfy
   applicable source/relinking obligations. See [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md).
8. Update the changelog, choose a version/tag, and write release notes with
   known issues, requirements and tested hardware. Do not invent a release
   version from the development commit count.
9. Compute a SHA-256 checksum for the final zip using `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256`.
10. Upload the zip and checksum to a GitHub Release only after approval.

The CI workflow checks code and offscreen tests, not GPU correctness or complete
binary licensing. A source upload and a redistributable Windows release are
different deliverables. Never include real user caches or settings in either.
