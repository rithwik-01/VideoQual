"""The packaging policy for GStreamer: what the Windows build ships of it.

Two layers. The dependency walk is tested on made-up graphs, because that is
where a subtle bug would hide. The policy is then run against the wheels
actually installed in the development environment, when they are, to prove
the allow-list names real plugins, that everything it reaches is kept, and
that the things imports cannot reveal are kept anyway.
