"""Shared test fixtures.

The important one is `isolate_user_state`: without it the suite reads and
writes the *user's real* settings file and results cache. That is not just
untidy -- a test that ticks "compute PSNR by default" persisted it, which
then leaked into every later test in the run AND into the installed app.
It also keeps the suite off the machine's power state.
