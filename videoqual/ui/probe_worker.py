"""Probes newly added videos, and loads their cached results, off the UI
thread.

Both steps are slow enough to be felt: ffprobe is a subprocess launch
(~70ms for a small file, more for a large one on a slow disk), and a cached
result for a feature-length run is a ~9MB JSON parse (~140ms). Doing eight
videos inline froze the window for a couple of seconds with no feedback.
