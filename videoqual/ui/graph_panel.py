"""The VMAF/PSNR/SSIM/XPSNR-vs-time comparison graph.

Supports overlaying multiple runs (e.g. several distorted encodes compared
against the same or different sources) as separate colored curves, with a
shared time-synced hover readout and a side-by-side stats comparison table.
Each metric (VMAF, PSNR, SSIM, XPSNR) gets its own tab/plot -- they're
different scales (0-100, dB, 0-1, dB) that don't belong on one axis -- while
the series list and stats table at the top are shared across all of them,
since it's the same set of runs either way.

This is a QWidget, not a window: it is one page of the main window's tabs.
