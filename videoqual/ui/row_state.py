"""How a test-video row's analysis stands: the phrase on its file name.

The states were English strings, set in one place and compared in others
-- "Failed", "Reading...", a state that starts with "Finished" -- so a
reworded state quietly stopped matching. Each is a member here; its value
is the English text, marked for translation (N_) and shown with tr().
