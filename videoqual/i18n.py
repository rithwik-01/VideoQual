"""The window's text in the user's language.

The app opens in Windows' display language when it has a translation for it
-- Settings > Window > Language can choose another -- and in English
otherwise. Only what the window shows is translated. The log, saved results,
exported files and the self-test stay in English: a log is read by whoever is
fixing a problem, and the files by other programs. So do metric names (VMAF,
SSIMULACRA2, CVVDP...) and what FFmpeg itself says.

In the code, tr("Calculate metrics"): the English text is the key into
translations/<code>.json, and is what shows when there is no translation.
Placeholders are str.format fields, tr("{done} done", done=3); a literal
brace in such a text is doubled. ntr() takes the form for a number by the
language's plural rules. N_() marks English text kept as data (a label in a
table of definitions) that is translated with tr() where it is shown.

The core modules speak English: their statuses and errors go to the log as
they are. tr_message() translates such a message as the window shows it, when
it has one of the shapes in MESSAGE_TEMPLATES; anything else -- FFmpeg's own
words, a path -- stays as it came.
