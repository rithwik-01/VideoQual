"""Black-bar (letterbox/pillarbox) detection via ffmpeg's cropdetect filter.

cropdetect with reset=0 reports the *tightest* crop box that still contains
every non-black pixel it has seen so far in the analyzed window -- a single
bright pixel of noise near an edge can prevent any crop from being detected.
To be robust we sample several short windows spread across the middle of the
video (skipping fades at the very start/end) and take the most common result
across windows, rather than trusting a single long pass.

The windows are independent, so they run at the same time rather than one
after another: measured on a 4K HEVC source, five sequential windows took
6.9s and five concurrent ones 2.0s. Each may decode on the GPU when the run
itself would, falling back to software on its own if that fails -- the
decoded pixels are identical either way, so the box is too. And the answer
for a file is kept for the life of the process: a batch of six encodes of
one film used to detect the source's bars six times over.
