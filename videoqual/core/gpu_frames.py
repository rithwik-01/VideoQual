"""Decoding a video on the GPU in the scoring process for the GPU metrics:
on NVIDIA GPUs straight into GPU memory (videoqual/native/nvdec_frames.dll),
on Intel's and AMD's into system memory through their makers' decoder
libraries (vpl_frames.dll with oneVPL, amf_frames.dll with AMF) -- all built
by scripts/build_gpu_frames.ps1 from native/, with one C API
(native/gpu_frames.h).

The GPU metrics used to get their frames from FFmpeg: FFmpeg decoded on the
GPU, copied each picture back to system memory, converted it and wrote it
to a pipe, which the scoring process read into memory the GPU then copied it
from again. At 4K that is several CPU copies of 25 MB per frame and per
video -- most of a GPU metric's CPU use, and at 200 frames per second more
than a pipe carries. Here FFmpeg only copies the compressed stream out of
its container (-c:v copy: a few MB per second) and the GPU's decoder decodes
it in this process. NVIDIA's pictures stay on the GPU: libvmaf reads them
there, and Vship's page-locked buffers are filled by the GPU's copy engine.
Intel's and AMD's decoders hand their pictures over in system memory, and
one CPU pass puts each into Vship's buffer (on Intel's integrated GPUs,
system memory is the GPU's own).

The pictures are the ones FFmpeg's decode gives, sample for sample: the same
decoder hardware, the stream's display area, a crop rounded as FFmpeg's crop
filter rounds it (its edges to even, for 4:2:0), and P016's 10-bit samples
either kept in the top bits (Vship reads them as 16-bit) or shifted down,
which is FFmpeg's conversion to yuv420p10le exactly -- and 8-bit samples
widened to 10 bits as FFmpeg widens them. A picture the comparison scales is
scaled here with FFmpeg's filter for the algorithm chosen (native/
scale_filter.h; by the GPU on NVIDIA's, the CPU on Intel's and AMD's): not
FFmpeg's to the sample -- within 1 of it on film -- which the user decided is
the same comparison (ComparisonRecipe.identity_dict). Which pictures come out,
and with which timestamps, is checked against the packets that went in
(GpuFrameStream.verify): a picture the decoder dropped or added fails the run,
and the caller makes it again through FFmpeg.

What is not decoded here -- another GPU, a codec or format the decoder
does not take, an interlaced or damaged stream -- goes the
FFmpeg way as before (GpuDecodeUnavailableError before the first picture,
GpuDecodeFailedError after it).
