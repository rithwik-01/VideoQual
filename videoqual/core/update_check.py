"""Is there a newer release? Asked once, when the app starts.

The releases are published on GitHub, and GitHub's public API names the
latest one -- drafts and pre-releases left out -- so no server of our own is
needed. No key either: GitHub allows 60 such requests an hour from one
address. Nothing is sent but the request itself; GitHub sees the address it
comes from, as it would for any page.
