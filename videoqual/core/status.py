"""Status messages that carry, beside their words, what the app reads from them.

A run reports what it is doing as text for the window's run line and the
log. Some of it was also read by the app -- where each video is decoded,
from "(GPU decode: source cuda, distorted cpu)"; that VMAF on the GPU had
failed, from the words it began with; that a step only said FFmpeg was
starting -- by searching the English words with regular expressions and
prefixes. Reworded, or a step added, and the app quietly misread its own
messages. A Status is that text, and those facts as data.

It is a str, so whatever only shows or logs the text needs nothing new, and
it pickles with its data across the processes the GPU code runs in
(core.isolated).
