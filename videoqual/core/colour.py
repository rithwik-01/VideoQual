"""How a video's colours are read for the perceptual metrics: its matrix,
transfer, primaries and range, from its tags -- the H.273 numbers -- with
untagged ones guessed as FFVship (Vship's own tool) guesses them.

One reading for both implementations: Vship is given these numbers on the
GPU (perceptual_vship._vship_colorspace), and the CPU tools get pictures
converted and described the same way (perceptual_cpu). Read differently,
the two scored the same frames far apart: a tagged BT.709 film, 40.4
