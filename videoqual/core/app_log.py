"""The app's log file: what ran, how it went, and every failure in full.

A metric that failed during an overnight run said why only in a tooltip,
and the tooltip went with the window: after a restart nothing was left to go
on. The log keeps each session's setup, every run and its steps, and every
failure with its full text, in <user data>/logs/VideoQual.log --
rotated at 5 MB, with four older files kept.

Only the app turns it on (start_logging, from videoqual.main). Imported by
tests or scripts, the package logs nowhere.
