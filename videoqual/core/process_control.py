"""A thread-safe handle for pausing/resuming the ffmpeg subprocesses of one
job.

This is an OS-level suspend (like Task Manager's "Suspend"), not a
checkpoint: the process is frozen in place and CPU/GPU usage drops to zero,
but it must stay alive in memory to be resumed -- closing the app or
rebooting loses the run, same as a hard cancel would.

One handle can address several processes at once. A job is usually one
ffmpeg, but black-bar detection runs its sample windows as a handful of
short-lived processes concurrently, and Pause or Cancel pressed during that
moment has to reach every one of them -- a handle that remembered only the
most recent pid left the others running.
