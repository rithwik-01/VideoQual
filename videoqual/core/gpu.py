"""GPU / hardware-decode capability detection.

We keep this deliberately conservative: pick a decode hwaccel that's likely
to work for a given video's codec, and let vmaf_runner fall back to
software decode if the hardware path fails to launch.

The two inputs of a comparison are decided independently. They are
unrelated bitstreams -- a 10-bit HEVC master against an AV1 encode of it --
so one can be GPU-decodable on this machine while the other is not, and a
single shared answer would have to be "no" whenever either side was
unsupported.
