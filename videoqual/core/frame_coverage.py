"""Whether a comparison covered the frames its two videos say they have.

Every scorer stops where the shorter input's pictures end -- libvmaf's frame
sync (shortest=1), Vship's and the CPU tools' readers alike -- which is right
for two files a frame or two apart. It also scored a file whose pictures end
long before its length says: a truncated 10-second encode, five frames of
picture, was given VMAF 98 as if for the whole video. The two lengths are
checked to agree before a run (vmaf_runner.validate_video_pair), so frames
missing at the end mean a file was cut short.
