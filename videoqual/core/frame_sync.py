"""The frame pairs FFmpeg's libvmaf filter compares, worked out from the two
videos' timestamps: FFmpeg's frame sync (libavfilter/framesync.c) with the
options vmaf_runner gives libvmaf and the GPU's overlay pairing
(FRAMESYNC_OPTS: shortest=1, repeatlast=0, ts_sync_mode=nearest). VMAF on
the GPU uses it for the videos decoded in its own process
(vmaf_cuda.score_decoded), where no FFmpeg filter graph pairs them.

How that frame sync pairs two inputs, for this configuration:

- each input's timestamps start at 0 (the chains' setpts=PTS-STARTPTS), and
  the second input's are rescaled to the first's time base, rounded to
  nearest (framesync's time base is that of its only synchronising input);
- each frame of the first input (the test video, the "main" input) gives
  one pair, when it is the earliest frame either input has next;
- the second (the source) moves on to a frame of its own when that frame is
  the earliest next, or -- "nearest" -- when that frame is strictly nearer
  the time being decided than the frame it has: a source frame stamped a
  millisecond after a test frame pairs with it, not with the one before;
- when the test video ends, so does the comparison; when the source ends,
  its end is stamped one tick after its last frame, and the comparison ends
  at the first test frame at or past it (shortest=1).

tests/test_frame_sync.py checks it against FFmpeg's own pairing (the
overlay vmaf_runner._gpu_pairs_stage uses) on many patterns of timestamps.

#: Both libvmaf and xpsnr are framesync filters, and framesync's defaults are
#: wrong for measurement: repeatlast=true extends the last frame of the
#: secondary input past its EOF, and eof_action=repeat keeps the comparison
#: going. A distorted file two frames longer than the source -- routine
#: encoder padding, and well inside the duration tolerance -- therefore got
#: two extra "scores" comparing real distorted frames against a frozen copy
#: of the source's final frame. Those frames score terribly (48 and 31 on a
#: 30-frame fixture that is otherwise ~100) and drag the aggregate down, so
#: the run silently reports a worse encode than was delivered.
#:
#: The default ts_sync_mode pairs each distorted frame with the last source
#: frame at or before its timestamp. Two files with the same frames can have
#: timestamps a millisecond apart -- MKV stores whole milliseconds, and each
#: program rounds frame times from its own clock -- and a distorted frame
#: stamped 1 ms early was compared with the source's previous frame: VMAF 0
#: and XPSNR ~16 dB at scene cuts and in motion, on an anime episode whose
#: SSIMULACRA2 (paired frame by frame) was 93 on the same frame. "nearest"
#: takes the source frame nearest in time, the same frame whichever way the
#: two timestamps are off by less than half a frame.
