"""Runs native GPU code -- Vship, libvmaf through ctypes -- in a process of its
own, so that a crash in it ends that process and not the app.

A library loaded with ctypes runs in the caller's process: an access
violation in it, or in the GPU driver under it, killed the whole app with
every video's progress, with no message. run_isolated calls a module-level
function in a child process instead and gives back what it returned, or
raises what it raised; if the child dies without either, it raises
IsolatedCrashError, which callers treat like any other failure of that step
(the CPU fallback, a failed metric).

The child is a spawned Python (multiprocessing), the frozen app included:
main.py calls multiprocessing.freeze_support() first thing. What crosses the
boundary is pickled: the arguments, the result, every callback's arguments
and the exception, with its attributes. While the child runs:

- callbacks named in `callbacks` run in this process, in the order the child
  made them, on the thread that called run_isolated;
- `process_handle`: the processes the child attaches to its handle (FFmpeg)
  are attached to this one, so Pause and Cancel reach them as before;
- `cancel_event`: when it is set the child and everything it started are
  ended, and `cancelled` is raised;
- the child's log records are logged here, under their own logger names;
- if it crashes, where each of its threads was (faulthandler) is logged here
  with the crash.
