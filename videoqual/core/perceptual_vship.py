"""GPU implementation of the perceptual metrics via Vship's C API.

The API is Vship 5.1's (Vship_InitHandler / Vship_ComputeHandler, see
https://codeberg.org/Line-fr/Vship/src/tag/v5.1.1/src/VshipAPI.h); the older
per-metric functions are a deprecated compatibility layer in 5.1.

SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli score each frame pair on its own; CVVDP is
temporal and scores the video (see _CvvdpLane).

FFmpeg decodes, crops, samples and scales -- the same FFmpeg as the rest of
the app, so every codec it reads works, VVC included, with hardware decode
per input where the GPU has one. It streams tightly packed frames into rings
of pinned host buffers (see _FrameStream). A video the GPU's decoder
decodes -- NVIDIA's with Vship's CUDA build, Intel's or AMD's with any -- is
decoded in the scoring process instead (gpu_frames, _NativeFrameStream):
FFmpeg only copies its packets out of the container, and each picture goes
into the ring without FFmpeg's CPU copies and the pipe -- the same pictures.
Vship converts each
frame from the colorspace it is described in (_vship_colorspace) and
computes the metric on
the GPU -- through Vship's CUDA build on NVIDIA, its HIP build on AMD, or
its Vulkan build, which runs on any GPU with a Vulkan driver (see
VSHIP_BUILDS). Vship takes a frame as three planes, so a hardware-decoded
frame
crossing the pipe in the decoder's NV12/P010 layout has only its chroma
split into planes here (see _passthrough_format). No FFVship or FFMS2
executable is bundled.

    each pass as it starts: its number, how many there are, and the keys of
    the metrics it scores -- the run line's figures are per metric.

    One metric at a time by default: each gets a pass of its own, and the
    video is decoded again for each. Scoring them in one pass holds every
    metric's GPU memory at once -- 7.3 GB for SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli and
    CVVDP together on a full 3840x2160 frame (Vship's CUDA build; its Vulkan
    build reports no memory size to check against), more than an 8 GB card has
    free -- for little speed where the GPU decodes: 34 fps together against
    about 31.5 fps one after the other at 4K, and 91 against 90.5 fps at
    1080p (RTX 5090, Beekeeper AV1 and a synthetic SDR clip). One at a
    time, the peak is the largest single metric: SSIMULACRA2 2.7 GB,
    Butteraugli 4.4 GB, CVVDP 4.8 GB.

    `together` (Settings > GPU metrics) scores them in one pass anyway (see
    vship_passes): where the CPU decodes -- 4K VVC, which no GPU decodes --
    decoding each video once instead of once per metric saves far more
    than the memory costs. A metric that fails in a shared pass, out of GPU
    memory most likely, is calculated again in a pass of its own.

    A metric whose pass fails is reported in the output's `failures` while
    the others still run; only when every pass fails is the first error
    raised (and the caller may retry on the CPU).
