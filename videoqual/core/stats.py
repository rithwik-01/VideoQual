#: How a metric's per-frame scores combine into one number for the run.

#: and for libvmaf's PSNR, which clamps a perfect frame to its bit depth's
#: ceiling -- 60 dB at 8-bit, 72 dB at 10-bit -- rather than reporting
#: infinity. Verified over 4.2M frames of real results: VMAF, PSNR and SSIM
#: never produced a single infinite value.
#:
#: "square_mean_root" is XPSNR's own sequence average, and XPSNR is the one
#: metric here that does report infinity for an identical frame. FFmpeg's
#: vf_xpsnr accumulates sqrt(wsse) per frame and reports
#:
#:     10*log10(W*H*max_error / (sum_sqrt_wsse / N)^2)
#:
#: Since a frame's own value is xpsnr = 10*log10(W*H*max_error / wsse),
#: sqrt(wsse) = sqrt(W*H*max_error) * 10^(-xpsnr/20), and the constant
#: cancels when it is substituted back, leaving
#:
#:     -20 * log10( mean( 10^(-xpsnr_i/20) ) )
#:
#: which needs nothing but the per-frame values. An identical frame has
#: xpsnr = inf, so it contributes 0 to the sum and 1 to N -- exactly what
#: ffmpeg's own accumulator does with sqrt(0). Checked against ffmpeg's
#: printed average on the same clip: 54.9459 over 72 frames and 45.0831 over
#: 480, matching to four decimal places both times.
