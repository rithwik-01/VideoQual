# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve VideoQual. Start with an issue for
large changes, new playback backends, or changes to metric definitions.

## Development setup

Use Windows for the native playback path. From the repository root:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip check
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m videoqual.main
```

Install FFmpeg 9+ with `libvmaf` and `xpsnr`, and put its `bin` directory on
PATH. `ffprobe` and, for fallback audio, `ffplay` should accompany it.
Native HDR tone mapping needs the optional shader build described in
[BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md). See [known limitations](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) before
choosing a Python version; Python 3.14.0 has an unresolved crash in our tests.

## Tests and style

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check videoqual tests
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
git diff --check
```

The tests run in parallel by default (pytest-xdist, one worker per core, at
most 12; see `addopts` in pyproject.toml). Add `-n 0` to run serially, for
example to debug one test with `print` or a debugger.

Add `--packaging` when you change what the Windows build ships
(`scripts/qt_bundle.py`, `scripts/gstreamer_bundle.py`): it also checks
those lists against the installed PySide6 and GStreamer wheels, which takes
about 12 seconds. CI always runs them.

Tests run offscreen and isolate settings and result caches. Preserve that
isolation in new tests. Some tests run actual FFmpeg encodes; do not replace
those with mocked success merely to make CI green. Hardware playback, HDR,
audio sync and performance still need interactive testing on real hardware.

Follow `ruff.toml` and nearby code. Use NumPy arrays for per-frame hot paths,
keep expensive work off the UI thread, and route subprocesses through
`videoqual.core.proc`. Read [the architecture guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Pull requests

- One bug fix per commit, with its regression tests in the same commit.
- Explain the symptom, cause, fix and verification in the commit body.
- Keep refactors separate from behavior changes. Avoid unrelated formatting.
- For bug fixes, check that the new test fails without the fix when feasible.
- Treat persistence/cache changes as deliberate behavior changes and document them.
- Document new settings and any changes to score interpretation.
- Include screenshots for UI changes, using generated or shareable media.
- Report skipped tests and hardware-dependent checks you could not perform.

Do not commit private media, user result caches, local settings, binaries or
secrets. A result export can contain absolute media paths. Never clear real
user caches as test setup. Do not silently upgrade a contributor's runtime.

## Reporting problems

Use the bug-report template with exact steps, expected/actual behavior,
versions and sanitized diagnostics. Prefer a small generated reproducer over
a feature film. Send suspected vulnerabilities through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
Keep discussion respectful and focused on the code; see
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
