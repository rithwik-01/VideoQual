# --- GStreamer -------------------------------------------------------------
# The wheels are ordinary directories whose own paths are computed from
# __file__ (see gstreamer_libs.environment), so every shipped file keeps its
# path relative to site-packages and each wheel still finds its own bin/,
# plugin and typelib directories.
#
# Not every file is shipped. The wheels are a complete media framework (302
# MB); the app plays two videos through D3D11 and one soundtrack, which
# needs about a sixth of that. scripts/gstreamer_bundle.py
# holds the allow-list of plugins and computes their dependencies from the
# DLL import tables; scripts/verify_gstreamer_bundle.py then proves the
# packaged runtime can still do everything the app asks, as part of the
# build. Change what is shipped there, not here.
#
# The packages are shipped as DATA and excluded from analysis on purpose.
# Frozen as modules their __file__ would point inside the archive, and every
# path they derive from it -- GST_PLUGIN_PATH, GI_TYPELIB_PATH, the plugin
# scanner executable -- would point at files that are not there.
