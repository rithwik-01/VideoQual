# Changelog

## v1.4

- VMAF v0.6.1 and VMAF NEG can now be calculated on NVIDIA GPUs.
- GPU metrics now take frames straight from the GPU's video decoder (NVIDIA,
  Intel and AMD) instead of through FFmpeg, using much less CPU and running
  noticeably faster.
- Updated Vship's Vulkan build to 5.1.2, with SSIMULACRA2 on Intel GPUs.
- A crash in Vship, libvmaf or the GPU driver while calculating metrics no
  longer closes the app.
- Reworked the progress line, with each metric's progress and time remaining.
- VMAF NEG now sits beside VMAF v0.6.1.
- Fixed wrong scores for videos with an odd width or height when decoded on
  NVIDIA GPUs.
- Fixed SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli and CVVDP comparing mismatched frames when a
  video has dropped or extra frames.
- Fixed CPU SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli scores being far from the GPU's on SDR
  video. Saved CPU scores are recalculated once.
- Fixed 24 fps videos being accepted against 23.976 fps ones (and 30 against
  29.97, 60 against 59.94).
- Fixed GPU metrics on PCs whose only GPU is Intel's.
- Fixed FFmpeg's GPU decoding not being used on AMD GPUs.

### Minor bug fixes

- A video whose pictures end long before its stated length now fails instead
  of being scored.
- Fixed XPSNR missing from the table and CSV with frame subsampling and VMAF on
  the GPU.
- Fixed MKV videos with a soundtrack longer than the picture failing with
  "Durations do not match".
- Fixed MP4 files whose cover art comes before the video comparing or playing
  the cover.
- Fixed a crash on exit on PCs with a Vulkan loader but no Vulkan driver.
- Fixed adding videos whose name or title contains curly quotes, some accented
  letters, or Chinese, Japanese or Korean text.
- Fixed the Video bitrate column including the soundtrack for MKV files (marked
  ≈ where it can't be separated).
- Fixed loading a saved run of a listed video adding a second row.
- Fixed the window opening wider than its default size in Spanish and
  Portuguese with some system fonts.
- Fixed Video Compare's status line for references without a soundtrack.
- Fixed an occasional crash when running from source, started from another
  Python program.

### How VMAF on the GPU works

libvmaf, the library that calculates VMAF, has CUDA versions of the features
VMAF is made from (VIF, ADM and motion), but they can't simply be used. No
FFmpeg build the app can rely on includes them, and as merged they score
differently from the CPU: libvmaf's issues and pull requests report randomly
low motion scores, NaN VIF scores, and ADM differing from the CPU's at the
frame edges.

So VideoQual bundles its own libvmaf with CUDA, built from libvmaf
master ([cea2b4d8](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/commit/cea2b4d832a105116a3f16f56d6f5d953421952c))
with 12 open pull requests merged in, each pinned to the commit we tested:

- [#1477](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/pull/1477): a native Windows (MSVC)
  build.
- [#1573](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/pull/1573): CUDA build fixes, and a
  crash with pinned picture memory.
- [#1583](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/pull/1583): a race in the motion
  feature that gave randomly low motion scores, and a double flush at the end
  of a video.
- [#1644](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/pull/1644) and
  [#1612](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/pull/1612): motion at the frame
  edges, which now mirrors them as the CPU does, and on the first frame.
- [#1614](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/pull/1614): a race in VIF that gave
  NaN scores.
- [#1647](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/pull/1647) to
  [#1651](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/pull/1651): five places where ADM's
  CUDA code differed from the CPU's (contrast masking, rounding, border
  clamping, an angle constant and a denominator shift).
- [#1652](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/pull/1652): both frames released
  when one fails to score.

With them, VIF and ADM on the GPU are identical to the CPU's. Motion differs
by about 0.00003, because its CUDA kernel rounds its blur in a different
order ([libvmaf issue 1562](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/issues/1562),
not fixed yet). Every frame's VMAF is within 0.00006 of the CPU's, and VMAF
NEG within 0.0008, so a saved score is reused whichever calculated it.

`scripts/build_libvmaf_cuda.ps1` builds it from exactly these commits, and two
builds give the same file. libvmaf scores on the GPU in a process of its own,
so a crash in it or in the NVIDIA driver calculates that video's VMAF on the
CPU instead of closing the app.

Where NVIDIA's decoder can decode both videos, that process decodes them too:
the pictures are cropped, scaled and paired on the GPU and handed to libvmaf
there, without ever being copied to system memory. Otherwise FFmpeg decodes
and pairs the frames and pipes them to it. Either way the frames are paired
by timestamp exactly as FFmpeg's own libvmaf filter pairs them.

VMAF v1 (which has no CUDA version), custom models, resolution tests, 12-bit
videos and comparisons at an odd width or height stay on the CPU.

Thanks to the authors of these pull requests. We hope they are merged, so that
everyone gets accurate VMAF on the GPU.

### Known issues

- On the integrated Intel GPU of a Core Ultra 9 285K, CVVDP fails on 4K videos
  ("A GPU Call failed inside Vship"). SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli are not
  affected.
- On HDR (PQ) video, SSIMULACRA2 on the CPU and on the GPU still differ
  widely (35 against 47 on one film): libjxl's tool handles HDR in its own
  way. Butteraugli agrees (2.89 against 2.88). Use the GPU score for HDR.

## v1.3

- Added the window in 20 languages: Simplified and Traditional Chinese,
  Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, German, French, Japanese, Russian, Korean,
  Italian, Polish, Turkish, Arabic, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Thai,
  Czech, Hungarian and Dutch. The app opens in Windows' display language, and
  Settings > Window > Language chooses another. The log, saved results and
  exported files stay in English.
- Added Intel GPU support for the GPU metrics with Vship's Vulkan build, which
  runs on any GPU with a Vulkan driver. Settings > GPU metrics > GPU backend
  chooses the build: Auto (the default) uses CUDA on NVIDIA, HIP on AMD and
  Vulkan on other GPUs. On Vulkan, SSIMULACRA2 is calculated on the CPU,
  because Vship 5.1.1's Vulkan build scores it too high (up to 17 points at
  4K).
- Updated the GPU metrics to Vship 5.1's API and color handling. Videos tagged
  BT.2020 SDR, SMPTE 170M (NTSC/DVD), Display P3, ICtCp or YCgCo, and
  monochrome and alpha videos, are now scored on the GPU instead of falling
  back to the CPU, and CVVDP no longer fails on them. RGB videos without a
  transfer tag are now read as sRGB, as Vship's own FFVship does, and their
  saved GPU scores are recalculated.
- Added a setting to calculate SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli and CVVDP together in
  one pass per video (Settings > GPU metrics, off by default). It decodes each
  video once instead of once per metric, which helps most with 4K VVC (decoded
  on the CPU), but needs more GPU memory.
- Each metric's score now appears and is saved as soon as it is done, instead
  of when the whole video is finished. Stopping a run or closing the app loses
  at most the metric in progress.
- Fixed test frames stamped slightly earlier than the source's being compared
  with the previous source frame, which gave clusters of near-zero VMAF NEG
  and XPSNR scores. Each test frame is now compared with the source frame
  nearest in time. Saved scores of affected videos are kept until they are
  recalculated.
- Hovering a red Failed cell now says why that metric failed.
- Added a session log under Settings > Storage > Log files, with Export log...
  (the log files as one .zip) and Copy log (the latest run) buttons.
- The app now checks GitHub for a newer release when it starts, and says so
  only if there is one. Turn it off in Settings > Window.
- Windows no longer goes to sleep while metrics are being calculated. The
  screen can still turn off.
- Included various small bug fixes and reliability improvements.

### Known issues

- With Vship's Vulkan build (Intel GPUs, or GPU backend set to Vulkan),
  Butteraugli and CVVDP are wrong for videos tagged with SMPTE 170M or 240M
  primaries (NTSC/DVD), and Butteraugli is about 2.5% off for videos tagged
  BT.470BG and for untagged SD videos. CUDA and HIP are not affected.
- 4:1:0 (yuv410p) videos cannot be scored on the GPU: SSIMULACRA2 and
  Butteraugli fall back to the CPU, and CVVDP is not calculated.

## v1.2.1

- Added a VMAF v1 column with its own model list. The existing VMAF column is
  now labelled VMAF v0.6.1, and scores saved by earlier versions still load.
  VMAF v1's Auto model is chosen by the resolution the videos are compared
  at: 4K and above uses the 4K / 1.5H model, because 1.5 screen heights is the
  standard viewing distance for 4K (VMAF v0.6.1's 4K model uses it too).
  Anything below 4K uses the 1080p / 3H model, the standard distance for HD.
- Reworked the run status: each video shows its CPU and GPU metrics progress
  separately, with elapsed time and a more accurate queue ETA, plus many
  related bug fixes.
- Cancelling a run will now keep the metrics a video had already finished.
- Cancelling a run will now stay on the Videos tab rather than jump to the
  Metric Graphs tab.
- Video Compare no longer re-checks the reference each time a different test
  video is picked.
- Fixed saved VMAF scores not loading on rows set to VMAF model Auto.
- Fixed the metrics ticked in the Videos tab column headers being unticked
  after a restart.
- Included various small bug fixes and reliability improvements.

## v1.2

- Added GPU support for ColorVideo VDP, SSIMULACRA2, and Butteraugli with
  Vship integration.
- Added CPU fallback for SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli with libjxl. ColorVideo
  VDP has no CPU fallback.
- Added CVVDP per-second scores and graphing alongside its whole-video score.
- Added an Add/remove metrics control to the Videos tab so metric columns can
  be shown or hidden, and new metrics can be added to completed analyses
  without recalculating existing results.
- Included various small under-the-hood bug fixes and reliability improvements.

## v1.1.1

- Fixed the metric graph clipping VMAF v1 scores above 100.
- Show the application version in the window title: VideoQual 1.1.1.
- Omit calculation-library version metadata from non-VMAF cache entries

## v1.1

- Added bundled Netflix VMAF v1.0 model files, including standard, 4K, phone,
  and HFR variants.
- Refactored metric execution around a shared registry and backend plan.
- Added per-metric results, provenance, and cache identities so saved results
  remain tied to the exact metric implementation and settings.
- Improved graph/readout handling for the generalized metric architecture.
