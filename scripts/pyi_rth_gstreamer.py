"""PyInstaller runtime hook: make the bundled GStreamer findable.

Outside a bundle this happens through `gstreamer_bundle.pth`, which the
interpreter runs at startup and which calls setup_python_environment() to
put GStreamer's bin/plugin/typelib directories into the environment and the
DLL search path. A frozen app does not process .pth files, so without this
`import gi` fails and playback silently falls back to FFmpeg.

It runs before the entry script, which is what it has to do: the environment
variables are read by GStreamer when it initialises, not when it is imported.
