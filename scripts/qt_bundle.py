"""Which of PySide6's files the Windows build ships.

PyInstaller's Qt hooks bundle by category -- everything a QtGui application
might conceivably load -- so a build that imports three Qt modules got a
software OpenGL renderer, QtMultimedia's FFmpeg, the whole QML stack (behind
one virtual-keyboard plugin), a PDF renderer, the network module with its
TLS backends, four platform plugins and 96 translations: 110 MB, of which
the app reaches 41.

This trims PyInstaller's analysis after the fact, the same way
gstreamer_bundle decides what to ship: an allow-list of the Qt modules the
app imports and the plugins it needs, their DLL dependencies read from the
import tables, and nothing else from the PySide6 folder.
